About 1 hours of learning.

Content Insights
----------------
When installing WordPress, you can skip most of the setup process by pre-loading the `wp-config.php` file with database information.

It's importantant to generate new security tokens in the `wp-config.php` when deploying automatically, otherwise the secret key for all the cookies and nonces will be known (`put your unique phrase here`.)

The WordPress codex is an excellent resource for the internal workings of WordPress and how to use the various APIs.

ThemeForest (or envato market) has one of the biggest collections of premium plugins and themes. Be careful of the license selected on checkout: There's a difference between a personal and commercial license.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
--------------------------------------
If one wishes to work at a hosting company, knowing how to automatically deploy WordPress is a valuable skill.

WordPress is a more valueable CMS to know due to its sheer market size.

Creating themes and plugins for WordPress can be an income stream for some, although it probably won't replace your day job.
