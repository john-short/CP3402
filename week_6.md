Learning Activities & Resources
-------------------------------
I refreshed myself on CI/CD pipelines.

* [Install Github Runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners)
* [Configure runner as a service](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/configuring-the-self-hosted-runner-application-as-a-service)

Estimated Hours
---------------
About 2 hours of learning.

Content Insights
----------------
Github seems to mainly use self-hosted runners.

Github provides an installation script `configure.sh`, and a run script, `run.sh`.

To make the runners into a service that's always available, you must use the `./svc.sh install [username]` command.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
--------------------------------------
CI/CD makes deployment easy and automated. It can be used not just for deployment, but also enforcing coding standards and ensuring only working code is deployed through testing.
